## Overview

The three-body problem is a classical problem in physics and mathematics that involves predicting the motion of three bodies interacting through gravitational forces. This code simulates the three-body problem and provides a real-time visualization using Tkinter and Matplotlib.

## Code Structure

The code is structured into two main classes and a main function:

1. `ThreeBodyProblem`: Handles the physics calculations and solving the differential equations.
2. `ThreeBodyAnimator`: Manages the visualization and animation using Tkinter and Matplotlib.
3. `main()`: Sets up the simulation parameters and runs the program.

## Class: ThreeBodyProblem

This class encapsulates the physics of the three-body problem.

### Key Methods:

#### `__init__(self, masses, initial_conditions, time_span)`
- Initializes the problem with masses of the bodies, initial conditions, and the time span for simulation.
- Sets the gravitational constant `G` to 1.0 for simplicity.

#### `equations_of_motion(self, t, state)`
- Defines the differential equations governing the motion of the three bodies.
- Calculates the gravitational forces between each pair of bodies.
- Returns the velocities and accelerations for each body.

#### `solve(self, time_points)`
- Uses `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` to solve the differential equations.
- Returns the solution containing the positions and velocities of the bodies over time.

## Class: ThreeBodyAnimator

This class handles the visualization of the simulation using Tkinter and Matplotlib.

### Key Methods:

#### `__init__(self, solution)`
- Sets up the Tkinter window and embeds a Matplotlib figure in it.
- Initializes the plot and canvas for animation.

#### `init_animation(self)`
- Sets up the initial state of the animation plot.
- Defines the axes limits, labels, and title.

#### `update_animation(self, frame)`
- Updates the plot for each frame of the animation.
- Draws the trajectories and current positions of the three bodies.
- Updates the time display.

#### `animate(self)`
- Creates the animation using `matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation`.
- Runs the Tkinter main loop to display the animation.

## Main Function

The `main()` function ties everything together:

1. Defines the simulation parameters:
   - Masses of the three bodies
   - Initial conditions (positions and velocities)
   - Time span and number of time points

2. Creates an instance of `ThreeBodyProblem` and solves the equations.

3. Creates an instance of `ThreeBodyAnimator` and starts the animation.

## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation:

1. Ensure all required libraries are installed (numpy, matplotlib, scipy, tkinter).
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. A Tkinter window will open, displaying the real-time animation of the three-body system.

The animation shows the trajectories of the three bodies and their current positions, with a time display indicating the progression of the simulation.

This code provides a flexible foundation for exploring the three-body problem, allowing for easy modification of initial conditions and masses to observe different behaviors of the system.
